I am excited to be a TA for [EE364A](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/) this summer!

# Bio
I am a third year EE PhD candidate at Stanford and blessed to be advised by Professor [Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/). My research is on convex optimization with a focus on developing custom solvers. 

I completed my bachelors in electrical and electronics engineering at Boğaziçi University, where I was admitted after ranking 1st among ~2 million students in national university entrance examinations [LYS 2016](https://docplayer.biz.tr/22331630-Mehmet-giray-ogut-elektrik-elektronik-muhendisligi-ingilizce-bogazici-universitesi.html). While in undergrad, I worked on early cancer detection under supervision of Professor [Utkan Demirci](https://bammlabs.stanford.edu) and my capstone project on modeling transmission patterns of computer worms was awarded the best senior design award in 2020.
