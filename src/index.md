# About

I am a EE PhD candidate at Stanford and consider myself extremely lucky to be advised by Professor [Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/). My research is on convex optimization with a focus on developing customized solvers. 

I completed my bachelors in electrical and electronics engineering at Boğaziçi University, where I was admitted after ranking 1st among ~2 million students in [LYS 2016](https://docplayer.biz.tr/22331630-Mehmet-giray-ogut-elektrik-elektronik-muhendisligi-ingilizce-bogazici-universitesi.html). In undergrad, I worked on early cancer detection with Professor Utkan Demirci. I also got involved in [computer vision](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Weng_Unsupervised_Discovery_of_the_Long-Tail_in_Instance_Segmentation_Using_Hierarchical_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf) and [foundation models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf?utm_source=morning_brew) during PhD rotations. 

# Teaching

I am very excited to be a TA for Stephen Boyd's [EE364A:Convex Optimization I](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/) class this summer! 
If you are studying the material in the [book](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf) or in [additional exercises](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook_extra_exercises.pdf) please do not hesitate to reach out to me so that we can think together. You can find coding tutorials on [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org).

My previous teaching experience at Stanford include:

* [CS224W:Machine Learning with Graphs](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/) (Fall 2021)
* [CS236G:Generative Adversarial Networks](https://cs236g.stanford.edu) (Winter 2021)

# Papers

Papers not related to convex optimization are accessible via [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wBkPd_cAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
Some of my illustrations have been chosen as journal covers in the past:

* [Advanced Materials, Vol 32, Issue 8, February 20, 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/adma.202070062) which was also a finalist in [Art of Science 2021](https://mrs.stanford.edu/art-science-2021-exhibition).
