PhD Candidate, Electrical Engineering, Stanford University  

# Bio

I am a third year EE PhD candidate at Stanford and blessed to be advised by Professor [Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/). My research is on convex optimization with a focus on developing customized solvers. 

I completed my bachelors in electrical and electronics engineering at Boğaziçi University, where I was admitted after ranking 1st among ~2 million students in [LYS 2016](https://docplayer.biz.tr/22331630-Mehmet-giray-ogut-elektrik-elektronik-muhendisligi-ingilizce-bogazici-universitesi.html). In undergrad, I worked on early cancer detection with Professor [Utkan Demirci](https://bammlabs.stanford.edu). I also got involved with [computer vision](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Weng_Unsupervised_Discovery_of_the_Long-Tail_in_Instance_Segmentation_Using_Hierarchical_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf) and [foundation models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf?utm_source=morning_brew) at the beginning of my PhD. 

# EE364A

I am excited to be a TA for Stephen Boyd's [EE364A](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/): Convex Optimization I class this summer! If you are studying the material in the [book](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf) or in [additional exercises](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook_extra_exercises.pdf) please do not hesitate to reach out to me so that we can think together. You can find coding tutorials on [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org).

My previous teaching experience at Stanford include:
* [CS224W](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/) Machine Learning with Graphs (Fall 2021)
* [CS236G](https://cs236g.stanford.edu) Generative Adversarial Networks (Winter 2021)

# Papers

* Papers not related to convex optimization are accessible via [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wBkPd_cAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)

# Covers

Using CAD, I illustrated for some of my publications and a subset of them were chosen as journal covers such as:
* [Advanced Materials, Vol 32, Issue 8, February 20, 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/adma.202070062) which was also a finalist in [Art of Science 2021](https://mrs.stanford.edu/art-science-2021-exhibition)
* [Advanced Materials, Vol 32, Issue 19, May 14, 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/adma.202070151) 
* [Advanced Biosystems, Vol 4, Issue 6, June, 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/adbi.202070062)
